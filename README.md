# recrecs

## Overview

recrecs is a python program/script with a Tkinter GUI that is meant to look though inputted text, find, and point out words that contain a keyword from a file.

## Usage

To use, just run `main.py`, paste your text into the large input box, and click "Go". Located words will be outputted to the text box to the right of the Go button. You can add or remove keywords in the `keywords.txt` file. Make sure that your keywords don't have spaces, and that they are separated by commas.

## What's with the name?

recrecs is an abbreviation for Reccomendation Reccomendations, as the program is being desinged to read reccomendation letters and then give pointers on them.

This project was created for a teacher at my school, when I asked them about tasks that they wish they could automate in some way. After "inputting grades", "reccomendation letters" seemed the best option for a small project.

## Can I help?

Sure! If you want to add some code or reccomend an improvement, feel free to open a pull request or an issue. This project is, again, small and just for fun, so it doesn't need to be perfect or advanced.
